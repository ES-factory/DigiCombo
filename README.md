You no longer need to waste your time on simple and repetitive tasks and you can save it for hard tasks that have a lot of value just only prepare the necessary inputs that include the coordinates and the text to be printed, leaving the rest to **Digispark Attiny 85**.

It uses [V-USB](https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html) and [HID protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device) for inject touch events and keystrokes that your Digispark recognized by your system as an external touchs creen and a keyboard

The operating systems in which it works correctly:
- Android
- Windows 10

## How to download
Just install the latest version of Arduino Idea and search for `DigiCombo` from the library management section.

## How to record touches
